# RUST-Language-Recognizer
The objective of this program set is to develop a program using the Rust programming language that will read the user’s inputs and derivate them using the BNF programming language grammar. 
The program will accept what the user enters as a string and will verify that certain conditions are true or false using the BNF grammar rule. 
If conditions are true, then the string will be derivated based on the BNF rules, otherwise there will be a message showing that an error occurred. 
The string must begin with the word “begin” and end with the word “end”. In the middle of both of these words are statements/statement lists/variables/expressions. 
If all conditions are met and the program grants its success, the program will proceed to do the string’s right most derivation. 
Possible variables are x,y,z; possible operations are + or -.
